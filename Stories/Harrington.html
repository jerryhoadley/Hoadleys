                    <p>The Harringtons were English and settled first near the Atlantic coast before gradually moving back into the 
                    interior of New York. Due to the slow process of early colonization, it is presumed that this journey took two 
                    generations. Lovica Harrington’s father was probably born in New York, but may have left England.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Lovica Harrington arrived in New York as a very small boy. She was quite large, five foot five in height and 
                    weighed 150 pounds. She had light brown hair and eyes. She was very religious, a strict Methodist, but very 
                    affectionate. She taught school, but was working in the mill when she met her husband. She is buried beside him 
                    in Dugway. Here is a copy of a letter she wrote to my father (her son Enoch Adelbert) on September 8, 1889.</p>

                    <p>My dear, dear son,</p>

                    <p>I received your ever welcome letter in due time, have waited to write to see how Charles got along as we had 
                    written to Fred that Charles was sick. I am glad to inform you that he is much better. I think I could not 
                    endure to have him taken away, it has caused many anxious thoughts, but I thank God and daily ask Him to restore him 
                    to health. Dear son, you do not know how glad I am, and how much good it does me to get a letter from dear Adelbert. 
                    God bless you my son and help you to love Him with heart and serve Him with all your perfect mind.</p> 
                    
                    <p>When with a memory takes me back to other days and I think of the little ones of long ago, it does not seem 
                    possible that we are so separated and that little ones are again growing up by those who were my little ones. Your 
                    babies are very dear to me.</p>

                    <p>I love both but somehow Claudy twines around my heartstrings, be patient with the dear little lambs, if ever you 
                    think of striking them stop and think if they are spared to grow up, how they will be called to endure, and if they 
                    should be called to an early grave, how every harsh word or blow would come back to cause you bitter tears. I often 
                    look back and wish I had had more patience with my dear little ones. You wished that my last days might be my 
                    happiest ones. I think that cannot be, My happiest were when I had husband, my happiest and children all at home.</p>
                    
                    <p>I remember the last winter we all spent together. Many of you trying to live as Christians. It was the happiest 
                    winter of my life, I thought at the time too much happiness to last. In the spring the family began to separate, 
                    I had to part with one and then another, all gone now but but how my heart doe ache for them somtimes. No wonder that 
                    am weary to see baby boy. I hope you all will prosper and come home once again.</p>
                    
                    <p>Dear boy, don't get discouraged. It does seem too bad that some people cannot appreciate kindness. I hope you will 
                    have your reward for all your kindness. And Letty too. I know she is one of the best women as they all praise her in 
                    their letters. Well, Deb, I am glad you have found a good wife, love and cherish her with all your heart. Well, 
                    Letty, I am glad you are not going away. To spend the winter, where would you be as with so happy with dear hubby. 
                    Stick to him through thick and thin. I wish you would move out to town in the writer, I am afraid you and the little 
                    ones will perish in the deep woods.</p>
                    
                    <p>Daughter, I would like to write you a long letter to you, but you will have to excuse me as I am suffering 
                    with a bad headache today. I suppose Elda is homesick by what her mothwr says but I think she should be
                    contented, she has her husband and child with her and that ought to make her happy. She likes company and I suppose 
                    gets lonesome. Comfort her all that you can, give her my love and tell her I will write to her next. I would like to 
                    have Fred come home but if it would make it better to have him come later, we will be content to have his stay. Now 
                    dear children, strive to be good, bring your babies up to love the Lord, to do this, you must love Him yourselves. You
                    must excuse all the mistakes, write often as convenient, both of you.</p>

                    <p>Love to all. Good Bye, Your ever loving Mother -</p> 
                    <p>Louisa Harrington White - 1889.</p>
