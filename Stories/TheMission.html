            <p><b>Over Japan</b></p>
            <p>We've finally notched up a mission to our credit! Our assignment was to scour the Tokyo area for PW camps, with the 
            aim of pinpointing their locations for future supply drops. Eve took off from here at 2 a.m. yesterday morning, reaching 
            the Japanese coast around 9:30. Our approach was at a mere 1000 ft., an unusually low altitude compared to the typical 
            10-20,000 ft. for raids. There was uncertainty about encountering flak or fighters, but to our relief, there was none at 
            all. We flew so low that you could clearly see the people below, and not a single person shook their fist at us!</p>

            <p>The first area we searched was southeast of Yokohama, amidst 3,000 ft. mountains. With an extra pilot on board, reaching 
            his 35th mission for the journey home, we navigated through the heavy clouds obscuring the mountains. Despite the 
            challenging conditions, Joe was determined to find something. We zigzagged through valleys sideways in our pursuit but 
            unfortunately came up empty-handed. The landscape is breathtaking, featuring dense forests, steep mountains, and numerous 
            waterfalls. Every available inch of ground is cultivated, no matter how small.</p>
            <br>
            
            <p>The next area was in Yokohama, and I had never seen anything like it. It’s a suburb of Tokyo and normally has a 
            population of about 200,000. You have to see it to believe it. Hundreds of blocks were completely flat, not even a wall or 
            a building sticking up. Complete streetcar lines were running, with long lines of people waiting at all the stops. 
            We didn’t see 50 automobiles in the three hours we circled the area, but there were lots of bicycles. There weren’t 
            5,000 people in the whole city, as there’s no place for anyone to live. Boats were sunk everywhere in the docks. We 
            circled there for over an hour at 800 feet, as there was supposed to be a very large camp in the city. But we couldn’t 
            have missed it. There was lots of red cloth hanging all over - I think that’s their national color of mourning. Then we 
            flew across Tokyo Bay to Chiba, but couldn’t find anything there. The POWs were supposed to signal us, but there was no 
            sign of anything. After a half-hour there, we flew back across to look over Tokyo. We buzzed over the Palace, of course, 
            but it wasn’t much. Tokyo is spread all over the place, like L.A., and pretty well built up in the industrial area towards 
            the harbor. We just about cracked up when we landed here at 8 p.m. last night. Several things went wrong.</p>

            <p>Everything went wrong at once, and you can thank Joe that you’re not a widow. We had to dive down over the cliff at 
            the end of the runway to get enough speed to keep from hitting. It scared the heck out of our passengers! It was his last 
            landing, too! The first and last missions always seem to be jinxed. We had numerous things go wrong here on the ground 
            before and after the mission, which made us mad. Imagine flying for 18 hours and then not having any food ready after 
            landing!</p> 
            
            <p>Guess the mail got screwed up, as I didn’t mail my Tuesday letter, and didn’t get a chance to write any yesterday. We 
            had a lot of fun over Tokyo flying formation with the Navy pilots, who were all over, really having a big time. They had a 
            hard time keeping up with our B-29, even with fighters. And talk about warships in the bay! The Navy is really big now. 
            They’re all in there for the signing.</p> 
            
            <p>If we can’t find any POW Camps to supply, maybe we’ll get home sooner. That’s supposed to be our job now.</p> 
                
            <p>Well, we had the honor of clustering Tokyo with low-level reconnaissance, whatever that means. The pilot with us had 
            bombed the place five times from high altitudes, and he really had the time of his life…</p>
            
            <p>Don’t send any books over, as it’s very difficult to send a package from here, and I hope to fly home someday, so I have 
            to keep my baggage weight down.</p> 
            
            <p>No mail again today - the last one I had was postmarked the 20th (nine days), and they come in from Connecticut the 22nd. 
            San Berdoo must have poor connections, as Mom's letters come a day quicker usually.</p>

            <p>Let me know what letters you are receiving when - the money order letters should have been in before this.</p>
                
            <p>All my love,</p>
