                        <p>James Francis Hoadley, known as Frank to his friends and relatives, lost an arm in a hunting accident, at 
                            age 14, but this did not deter him in his ambition to become an Educator. He started his teaching career in 
                            the Crockett-Martinez area, and over the years gradually worked his way south to the southern portion of the 
                            State, following his profession, namely: San Ramon, Hollister, Morgan Hill and Perris, Calif. He ended his 
                            career before his retirement, as Superintendent of Schools.</p>
