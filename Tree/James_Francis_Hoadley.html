                        <p>James Francis Hoadley and his wife set out in the spring of 1853 for California across the plains. After meeting 
                            with many hardships, they arrived in Shasta County on October 6th and settled in the town of Lewiston, 
                            Trinity County, where he established a trading post. He packed his goods on mules from Shasta over the Trinity 
                            Mountains. In 1855 he closed out his business and built a sawmill and toll road. While there he held the 
                            offices of town supervisor and justice of the peace a number of terms, and was postmaster for four years. 
                            In the fall of 1872 he sold out his interest in Lewiston and moved to Cloverdale, Sonoma County, where he 
                            engaged in the hardware business. He sold it in 1875 and made his first visit to his native town in Vermont. 
                            He returned to Cloverdale and again engaged in business with which he was occupied until his death. He was a 
                            justice of the peace and a notary public.</p>

                            educated and resided until 19 years of age, when he moved to Erie County, Pennsylvania, and remained 
                            about two years. </p>
                            <p>3 November 1852, he was married to Carrie (incorrect-should be-) Harriet C. Appleby, of Springfield, 
                                Erie County, Pennsylvania, and moved to Jefferson County, Wisconsin, where he remained until the spring 
                                of 1853. He then set out for California. Crossing the plains he arrived in Shasta County, October 6th 
                                of the same year. Remaining here a short time, he settled in the town of Lewiston, Trinity County, where 
                                he established a Trading Post, and packed his goods from Shasta over Trinity Mountain on mules until 1858, 
                                then he closed that out and built a saw mill and carried on a small farm. In the summer of 1865 helped to 
                                build a toll road, from Tower House in Shasta County to Lewiston. After about two years he became the 
                                owner of the toll road, and then completed it to Weaverville in Trinity County. While here he held the 
                                office of Supervisor two terms, and that of Justice of Peace one term; was Postmaster for four years. In 
                                the fall of 1872, he sold out his interest here and came to Sonoma County settling in Cloverdale. Here he 
                                formed a co-partnership with Isaac E. Shaw in a general hardware and grocery store, which lasted until 
                                January 1875 when he withdrew from the firm, and made a trip to his native State, leaving June 13th and 
                                returning the following September. He then purchased the lumber yard of Leander Shores, which business he 
                                has continued ever since. In 1876 he built the Centennial Warehouse at Cloverdale, since which time he has 
                                added and carried on a forwarding and commission business.</p>

                                    bear its full share in the future development of the interests of the city of Cloverdale and the
