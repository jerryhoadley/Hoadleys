<h2>The Hoadley Family</h2> 
<h3>Introduction</h3>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-9 col-md-6" style="background-color: #78a5f7">
<p>The Hoadley family originated in the south of England and is supposed to have derived its name from one of two parishes in Sussex, East and west Hoadly, (now spelled Hoathly), 
one in the rape of Leues, the other in that of Pevensey.</p>

<p>Mention is made in the Sussex Archeological Collections of Margaret; daughter and heir of Solomon de Hothlegh, (about 1280,) of William de Hodlegh, 1296, of Maurice de Hodleye, 
1318, (11th Edition ii). King Edward II sent Maurice de Hothlegh on an errand from Tunbridge to London.</p> 

<p>In Queen Elizabethrs time John Hodeley, of Lamberhurst on the borders of Kent and Sussex, 
had a chancery suit against the vicar.</p> 

<p>Thomas Hodely, of Sussex, pIeb., of Queens College Oxford, matriculated 7 December 1616, 
aged 18, B.A. 1629, M.A. 1623.</p> 

<p>In the 17th century there were a number by the name in various parishes of Sussex and Kent, 
who were small landholders, and the name is still to be found in those counties. </p>

<p>The place of birth neither of John Haadley of Guilford, nor of william of Branford, has as 
yet been ascertained, though there appears to be reason to suppose that the former came from 
Kent. That they are related is probable, but the fact rests only at present on family tradition.</p>

<h3>Thomas Hoadley </h3>
<h4>Of Hartland, Vermont,and His Descendants</h4> 

<p>The following are excerpts from the Thomas Hoadley Genealogy, as it relates to his great-great-grandson, 
James Francis Hoadley III (,fames Francis, Jr. #43 James Francis #8, Elias *2, Thomas #1) and his 
descendants. The original genealogy was authored by Francis Bacon Trowbridge of New Haven, Conn. in 1894. 
An extension was added in 1972 by Parker Comstock Hoadley of Sunnyvale, CA.</p>

<h5>Geneology</h5>
<h6>(1.) THOMAS HOADLEY</h6> 
<p>Was born in England in 1737. Nothing has been learned of his origin except that there 
seems to be a pretty general belief among his descendants that he was related to the family to which Bishop 
Hoadly belonged. He came to America with an only brother JOHN HOADLEY and settled near Boston, Mass. JOHN 
was unmarried and was drowned about the time of the Revolution. THOMAS married about 1760 MARY STONE, whose 
origin is unknown. Their children were born, it is said “near Boston,” but descendants of their fifth child 
(Elias) say he was born in Tewkesbury. THOMAS H0ADLEY paid a tax in Brookline in 1771 and 1775. He served 
in the Plassactrueetts Line in the Revolution and drew a pension from April 20, 1818. After the war he 
moved with his family to Hartland, Vermont, where he bought a farm on which he lived the remainder of his 
life. His wife MARY died there 13 June 1818, aged 80 years. He died there on 20 June 1829. *(*For much of the
