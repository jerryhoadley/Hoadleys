                    <p><h3>The Dutter Family</h3></p>

                    <p>We do not know what part of Holland the (Van) Dutters came from for it is not definitely known that they did. 
                    The family tradition was that they did, that two of them were Revolutionary soldiers who accepted land grants 
                    in Pennsylvania for back Army pay. Their descendants came to Ohio and then to Indiana. The name was anglicized to 
                    Dutter. To support that probability there is a prominent English family named Rutter, descended from a Dutch Ruyter 
                    or Reuter which would approximate the original pronunciation Dutter (Doyter) but most Dutch in Pennsylvania were 
                    Palatinate German, and the Dutters may have been. What Mums used to call the "Dutter book" is not a Dutter book 
                    at all, it is the family book of her step grandmother, and does not apply to mums. The Angabe, Ind. Chamber of 
                    Commerce could give no information, old family deeds or bibles would help or a genealogical search at Clark's Mills, 
                    Pennsylva of or Angola, Indiana.</p>

                    <p>The Dutter family originally lived near Allegania, Pennsylvania. There is a family record, called the 
                    "Dutter Book" privately printed every ten years.It has the family history in America for two hundred and fifty 
                    years.</p>
                    
                    <p>Henry, George, and Elizabeth Dutter lived near Angola, Indiana. Henry and George although full brothers were 
                    very unalike, Henry was small, fair and quiet. The wildness of the Dutter blood showed only in his profession.
                    He owned and managed a large race track. He bred race horses and eventually lost the greater part of his property.</p>

                    <p>George Dutter was large, dark, and quarrelsome. He fought many duels, and was covered with knife and bullet 
                    scars.</p>
                    
                    <p>The children of Henry Dutter were mostly fair. All of George Dutter's children were dark, even to swarthiness.</p>

                        States Armed Forces on the Western Front during World War I. The AEF was established on July 5, 1917, in France 
                        under the command of then-Major General John J. Pershing. It fought alongside French Army, British Army, Canadian 
                        Army, British Indian Army, New Zealand Army and Australian Army units against the Imperial German Army. A small 
                        number of AEF troops also fought alongside Italian Army units in 1918 against the Austro-Hungarian Army. The AEF 
                        helped the French Army on the Western Front during the Aisne Offensive (at the Battle of Château-Thierry and Battle 
                        of Belleau Wood) in the summer of 1918, and fought its major actions in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the 
                        Meuse-Argonne Offensive in the latter part of 1918.</p></li></ul></ul></ul>

                        <p>James Russell Lowell ("Loval") (February 22, 1819 – August 12, 1891) was an American Romantic poet, critic, 
                        editor, and diplomat. He was a member of the eighth generation of the Lowell family,[2] the descendants of Percival 
                        Lowle who settled in Newbury, Massachusetts, in 1639. His parents were the Reverend Charles Lowell (1782–1861), 
                        a minister at a Unitarian church in Boston who had previously studied theology at Edinburgh, and Harriett Brackett 
                        Spence Lowell By the time that James was born, the family owned a large estate in Cambridge called Elmwood.
                        He was the youngest of six children and his siblings were Charles, Rebecca, Mary, William, and Robert.
                        Lowell's mother built in him an appreciation for literature at an early age, especially in poetry, ballads, 
                        and tales from her native Orkney.[4] He attended school under Sophia Dana, who later married George Ripley; 
                        he later studied at a school run by a particularly harsh disciplinarian, where one of his classmates was Richard 
                        Henry Dana Jr.</p>

                        <p>LowellHe is associated with the Fireside Poets, a group of New England writers who were among 
                        the first American poets to rivaled the popularity of British poets. These writers usually used conventional 
                        forms and meters in their poetry, making them suitable for families entertaining at their fireside.</p>

                        <p>Lowell graduated from Harvard College in 1838, despite his reputation as a troublemaker, and went on to earn a 
                        law degree from Harvard Law School. He published his first collection of poetry in 1841 and married Maria White 
                        in 1844. The couple had several children, though only one survived past childhood.</p>

                        <p>He became involved in the movement to abolish slavery. Lowell used poetry to express his anti-slavery views and 
                        took a job in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the editor of an abolitionist newspaper. After moving back to Cambridge, 
                        Lowell was one of the founders of a journal called The Pioneer, which lasted only three issues. He gained notoriety 
                        in 1848 with the publication of A Fable for Critics, a book-length poem satirizing contemporary critics and poets. 
                        The same year, he published The Biglow Papers, which increased his fame. He went on to publish several other poetry 
                        collections and essay collections throughout his literary career.</p>

                        <p>Maria died in 1853, and Lowell accepted a professorship of languages at Harvard in 1854. He traveled to Europe 
                        before officially assuming his teaching duties in 1856, and married Frances Dunlap shortly thereafter in 1857. 
                        That year, Lowell also became editor of The Atlantic Monthly. He continued to teach at Harvard for twenty years.</p>

                        <p>He received his first political appointment, the ambassadorship to the Kingdom of Spain 20 years later. He was 
                        later appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James's. He spent his last years in Cambridge in the same estate where 
                        he was born, and died there in 1891.</p>

                        <p>Lowell believed that the poet played an important role as a prophet and critic of society. He used poetry for 
                        reform, particularly in abolitionism. However, his commitment to the anti-slavery cause wavered over the years, as 
                        did his opinion on African-Americans. He attempted to emulate the true Yankee accent in the dialogue of his 
                        characters, particularly in The Biglow Papers. This depiction of the dialect, as well as his many satires, was an 
                        inspiration to writers such as Mark Twain and H. L. Mencken.</p>

                        <p>James Russell Lowell was born February 22, 1819.  attended Harvard College beginning at age 15 in 1834, though 
                        he was not a good student and often got into trouble. In his sophomore year, he was absent from required chapel 
                        attendance 14 times and from classes 56 times. In his last year there, he wrote, "During Freshman year, I did nothing, 
                        during Sophomore year I did nothing, during Junior year I did nothing, and during Senior year I have thus far done 
                        nothing in the way of college studies. In his senior year, he became one of the editors of Harvardiana literary
                        magazine, to which he contributed prose and poetry that he admitted was of low quality. As he said later, "I was as 
                        great an ass as ever brayed & thought it singing"." During his undergraduate years, Lowell was a member of Hasty 
                        Pudding and served both as secretary and poet.</p>

                        <p>Lowell was elected the poet of the class of 1838 and, as was tradition, was asked to recite an original poem on 
                        Class Day, the day before Commencement on July 17, 1838.[9] He was suspended, however, and not allowed to participate. 
                        Instead, his poem was printed and made available thanks to subscriptions paid by his classmates.[11] He had composed 
                        the poem in Concord,[12] where he had been exiled by the Harvard faculty to the care of the Rev. Barzallai Frost 
                        because of his neglect of his studies.[13] During his stay in Concord, he became friends with Ralph Waldo Emerson and 
                        got to know the other Transcendentalists. His Class Day poem satirized the social movements of the day.</p>

                        <p>Lowell did not know what vocation to choose after graduating, and he vacillated among business, the ministry, 
                        medicine, and law. He ultimately enrolled at Harvard Law School in 1840 and was admitted to the bar two years later.
                        While studying law, however, he contributed poems and prose articles to various magazines. During this time, he was 
                        admittedly depressed and often had suicidal thoughts. He once confided to a friend that he held a cocked pistol to 
                        his forehead and considered killing himself at the age of 20.</p>

                        <p>Lady Polly Eggleston was the "Lady" who eloped with her father's coachman. According to one branch of the 
                        family she was the daughter of an English nobleman. She was disinherited for her marriage. Although she had 
                        eleven children, the marriage was never a happy one. She outlived her husband and is buried at Six Corners, 
                        St. Joe Co, Indiana. After her marriage she lived for many years in Genesee Co. New York. The Indiana 
                        house was a large three story red brick house, trimmed in white. It had a spiral Staircase with a prahogany 
                        hand rail stair case through the center halls.</p>
                            
                        <p>We know that the mother of either Lady Polly Eggleston or William Johnston was a Mrs. Walden, whose maiden 
                        name was church, but we are not able to trace the relationship any more closely. Great-great-great grandmother
                        Walden died in Genesee County, New York.</p>
