    <p><h4>Forward (by Hattie)</h4></p>

    <p>Ever since the beginning of the Hoadley Genealogy became a project of mine, and the farther that I delved into it, the more 
    curious I became, as I wondered what route our Great-Grandfather James Francis Hoadley took West, from Hartland, Vermont to Lewiston, 
    California.</p>
    <p>I was a January graduate in 1907 from Chico Normal, as it was called in those days.  We were told by the President of the colloge 
    to go out and rough it before we applied for a job in a city school. I did what he said to do. I applied and got in a country school
    of one room and eight grades in Medocino County. I went by Western Pacific to the end of the line at Sherwood and there took a Stage over 
    a narrow mountain road 13 miles to my destination. I was to room and board with a couple who had a little mountain ranch and was to tell 
    the stage driver to let me off at the lane that led up to theeir place. He deposited me and my trunk at the side of the road. I was
    young and brave no doubt, but it was a scary half hour before I heard the rattle of wheels and my future landlord came down the lane 
    to pick me up. The road was half a mile from the main road, and you had to cross a creek to get there. I was easy to ford when it 
    wasn't swolen by rains. It was heaven to reach the house and the welcome there. The next morning I was to open the school and meet my 
    pupils. The school house was a mile or two distant, and you had to foot it. I started out good and early with my lunch bag in my hand 
    and my head full of ideas and wondering what my day would look like.</p>

    <p><b>The School</b></p>
    <p>The school house was a typical country school with one room - painted whiteand surronded by a white picket fence. Several 
     children were waiting on the steps when I arrived. They were nice looking children. I smiled and they smiled. My heart warmed to
    all of them.I seemed they all came from farms or ranches nearby.Yhr inside of the school house was typical of one roomv country 
    schools. A pot bellied stove stood in the middle of the room, a little organ at the side, teacher's desk up front and facing
    the children's desks. A large water bucket stood on a bench near the back. The children informed me that there was an old well
    in the yard covered up with boards, but we had to use the pail to get ouer drinking water from a spring in the back o the school house. 
    In no time, it was time to start our first day. It took the morning to straighten out the grasdes, take the roll, get the book and
    needed material, and assign the seats. I never saw such quiet, obedient children. They ranged in are from six to seventeen,recess time 
    came, and they all stood around. Noontime came, and they all sat on the steps with their lunches. I decided to join them, which surprised
    them but I stayed with it and by the end of the hour, we were really getting acquainted. I seemed like they had never played any games
    or had any projects. In frpont of the little fence, there was a stretch of ground perfect for a baseball diamond. One of the boys Said
    he had a ball and bat art home, so me made plans to start baseball the next daI was really fun. In those days I could run those bases 
    as fast as the youngsters. For a project, we decided on a vegtable garden. I sent for government seeds, onions, carrots, radishes, and 
    letuce. In the meantime, the older ones brought picks, shovels, etc., and got the ground ready. The question was water, but the big boys 
    took care of that by using the old well. They did this every morning and kept thse seeds well wateres and in no time we were eating
    radishes with our lunches. The term was to be four months in length, and in that time I don't think there could have been a strnger bound
    anywhere between pupils and teacher than that which we had.</p>
    <p><b>The Picnic</b></p>
    <p>Spring was breaking out all over, and the country was beautiful. Easter was approaching, and I invited the children to an Easter
    egg hunt on Easter Saturday at the place where I boarded. They had never heard of an Easter Egg hunt. I collected, hard boiled, all the 
    eggs I cold get hold of and hid them in the tall grass of the appel orchard. It was in full bloom, and the very air was filled with
    its fragrance. I got sugar, vanilla, chocolate, and nuts and made platters of home made candy. I also got all the lemons in the 
    village store for lemonade and bought a lot of cookies. All was in readiness by ten o'clock in the morning, when I got my surprise. The
    children were expected by two o'clock, but instead they came a little after ten in the morning. My londlord said that was the custom. 
    I almost panicked , as I haden't thought of a lunch. The dear people with who,e I boarded said not to worry - to entertain them, and 
    they would fix something to eat. I went and welcomed the children and said, "Let's follow the leader". I led them up the creek amid lots 
    of fun. We jumped over logs and the little streams of water until it was about a safe time to start back. What a glorious surprise
    awaited us. The folks had spread two large colored tablecloths on the grass in the orchard. They had baked pans of baking powder 
    biscuits and filled them with jelly. I started the egg hunt amid shouts of laughter. When it was finished, the prepared lunch was carried 
    down to the orchard. It was really something - hot biscuits to eat with the eggs, cookies and lemonade for dessert, and lots of candy. 
    There were lots of eggs for the chidren to take home. I also gave them all the candy. We all sat around on the ground in that beautiful 
    setting talking and telling stories. The afternoon sun began to lower berfor the chindren got to their feet and started home. It
    was a wonderful day.</p>
    <p>Soon after, I had to get another boarding house bcause my landlady was in her late pregnancy and could no longer have me. A family
    who lived in a little house on the hill wanted me to board with them. I hesitated, as I had of the slovan ways of the mother and the way 
    the children had to live. There were four children - a boy seventeen, a girl fourteen, and a younger boy ansd girl. They were lovely
    children. Because they wanted me so badly and not to hurt their feelings, I decided to try it out. You can't imagine. There were two 
    rooms in the front and a lean-to in back. Thise chidren had cleaned out one room for me, screbbed it and papered it in newspapers. 
    They had a grandmother living not far away and from her they got a bedstead, spring and mattres, and evidently the clean bedding
    as the bed was nice and clean. Where the family slept, I never knew. I ate alone in the little lean-to kitchen. I stood it untilone
    night I saw the mother pick up the frying pan from the floo.r. The cats had been eating out of it, and it was still half full of cold 
    milk gravey. That mother poured some more milk into the dirty pan and mountainside enough gravy for dinner. That was the last straw 
    for me! I couldn't take it any longer. Not to hurt the children, I made some valid excuse to complete the term by staying with 
    another family. </p>
    
    <p>There was just a month left of the school" term, and I decided
    on one big project. That was to observe MernoriaL day, if possible. The
    chidren were always eager to cooperate, but before I mentioned it to them, there
    were inquiries that had to be made. There was a little country cemetery near
    our vilLage, and I found out that there were three or four Civil War Veterans
    burried there. Next, we should have a patriotic program fitting to the day and
    for it I wanted a platforrn of some sort. There was a little lumber mill not too
    distant, and I went to them and told my plans. They said they would deliver
    enough lumber for a small platform for $5.00 if I could get it built. I imagine
    you think I had a nerve. Well, I had more then than I have now. At this point I
    decided to tell the children my idea and plans, and they were all for it. The
    older boys said they and I could build the platforrn with maybe the help of a father
    or two. Well, we built it after school hours and on a couple of Saturdays. We
    worked hard on that patriotic program. We decided to take the little organ, as we
    had a couple of songs to sing in unison. Several were to recite poems, and the
    big event was to have a march. How we did practice. There was another school
    a few rniles distant. We asked thern to join us. I told them what songs we were
    singing and sent the teacher the name of the march and the outline of it. I also
    wanted the girls all to be dressed in white. One mother said that she could not
    sew. That was no problem. I told her to get the material and I would come and
    make the dresses, which I did. The day of the big affair arrived and all was in
    readiness. The children and I met at the schoolhouse. One parent arrived with a
    big hay wagon with fresh hay on the bed. There surely was excitement. First,
    they put in the little organ. Then, we all sat on the clean hay and off we went.
    Everyberdy went - all the mothers, fathers, and villagers. I had no idea there
    were so many people in those parts. They came from the other school, and
    everything went off beautifulLy. The other teacher took over the organ and played
    for the singing and the march. I couldnlt play by note but could by ear. After the
    program the children took the flowers that they had broaght and decorated the
    veterans' graves. The mothers brought a bountiful lunch, and we all sat under
    the lovely trees and enjoyed it all. water eating lunch, one of the men passed a
    hat and got the $5.OO for the lumber for the platform. It was a big day for all.
    I often recall it and wonder how many years that little platferrn stood there before
    it rotted away.</p>
    <p>With sadness the term came to an end. I departed for home on
        the stage with two little companions, a little black and white puppy which was half
        coyote and a little spotted fawn ia a wooden crate with a state permit tacked to it.
        I had had a wonderful experience which will never be erased irom my memory. <b>- Harriot Hoadley Harris (1974)</b></p>

    <p><h3>Part 2</h3></p>

    <p>I felt as though I wanted more experience in country schools,
    so the next fall term I took the prirnary grades in a two teacher school in Shasta
    County. I had lived in Shasta County as a child and knew the territory. The
    school was in a new mining town created when a cornpany built a smelter to smelt
    copper ore taken from a large mountain near by. It was a six month term and
    was interesting. I enjoyed the children and the very atmosphere of the place but
    decided to leave when the term ended. I longed, to see the children of my first
    school again, and as there was a chance to get a little school not too far from
    there for the spring term I took it. I was to travel by train, the western Pacific,
    to Willits and there to be met by a school trustee who would take me to my
    destination twenty-six miles distant. I went on a Sunday, but upon arriving at
    the station in Willits the Station master told me that Mr. McPike (the Trizstee)
    was there the day before with horses to get me. Was I forlorn! The Station Agent
    was very kind and told me the only thing to do was to go to the hotel for the night
    and make arrangements at the livery stable for a horse and buggy and driver to
    take me to my diestination the next morning. In those days we didn't have a lot of
    suitcases but always had a trunk which held all of our belongings.</p>
    
    <p>I was ready the next morning waiting for the driver to pick me up,
    He had a little light rig which couldn't take my trunk. That trip over a little
    narrow mountain road for twenty-six miles will never be forgotten. The country
    was beautiful and all bursting out with early spring. I was too upset to eajoy it,
    with no idea what to expect at the end of the tiip. Allmy belongings had been
    left behind at the depot, and I had only my purse with me. It was nearly noon
    when we came to the end of the road, and the driver said "this is it". There
    was a little clearing with a small cabin fenced in nearby. I hardly got a chance to
    look around after the driver left me (by the way, it cost $5 for that ride at that
    time) when two young giris appeared out of the trees. They were two of the pupils.
    They introduced themselves and said I was to board with the people who lived
    in the nearby cabin. They went in with me, but before we reached the place the
    door was opened and a woman appeared. I had to speak first. She stepped aside
    to let me in, but I only looked. There was only one room. A double bed on one
    side, a small stove, a little rough homemade table and a couple of straight chairs
    seemned to be all it contained. When I asked where I was to sleep, she said that
    they aimned to set up a cot in the corner. I later found out that her no good husband
    was never sober. For a moment I was frantic. I turned to the girls and said that
    I couln't stay there, and we walked away. I was twenty-six miles from nowhere
    with only my purse.</p>
    

    <p>The girls said they were sure I could stay with them, but they lived a long way down the mountain and 
    across the river. I grasped at anything, and we started out. We followed a steep mountain trail down the 
    mountain side. I wasn't dressed for mountain trails. I remember that I wore a brown suit, white blouse, high 
    heeled patent leather shoes, and a big brown hat on my head. After I thought the trail was never ending, we 
    came to the river. It wasn't a huge river - was called the Outiet as it originated many miles from Clear Lake in
    Lake County. We had to ford it. The children had a regular crossing place. Even there the water was well above 
    my knees. You can imagine my pLight trying to hold my skirts above the water and holding on to my shoes and 
    purse, With the girls help we reached the other side, and after rounding a bend in the trail we saw the house. 
    A sweet faced little woman came out to greet us. She welcomed me to board with them if I could stand the long 
    trip to school. Everything was very prirnitive but clean, and it seemed a haven after the days trials.</p>
        
     <p>The family was living there on the bank of that river to homestead the place. There were six children, 
    four of them school age. The two eldest were girls. One was fifteen, and the other thirteen. The father
    worked at a logging camp and came home on Sunday. There was a not far from the house, but the only livestock
    they possessed were two little jackasses they used to pack in their food and what not frorn Sherwood six miles
    away over a mountain trail. They had a Little garden spot near the river where they grew their only vegetables. 
    I never saw all of that house, only the kitchen where they cooked and ate, a sort of family room, and a small 
    lean-to bedrooom, where I slept with one of the girls. The family had very litte of this worlds goods. but
    everything was clean and the chilriren were taught the niceties of live. We all had napkins at meal time. They 
    were white as snow, but all were made of flour sacks. There was a tablecloth on the table, also made of flour 
    sacks. There was grace at every meal and plenty to eat, if not much of a variety. I learned to eat fried beans 
    for breakfast and to drink my coffee frorn a little tin can. However, I was young and hungry, and I ate and drank.
    How I managed to exist that first week with only my purse and the clothes I had on, I try not to remember, but I had to
    wait until the end of the week for the father to come home, get the little jacks, and go to Sherwood for my trunk.</p>
    
    <p>The morning after my arrival four of the children and I started off for the first day of school each 
    carrying a lard bucket with our noonday meal. That river had to be forded and that water was cold so 
    early in the morning, but we braved it, climbed the mountain, and finally reached the schoolhouse, which
    wasn't a schoolhouse but a tiny shake cabin with no out buildings. Inside there were desks for seven children 
    and room for a small teacher's desk. There were only seven children in the district. Four were from the 
    family with with which I boarded. A lone little boy came from a mountain ranch, and two little girls riding
    a big old horse from another direction miles away. By the time we got settled and acquainted, it was the 
    noon hour and for the first time in my life I partock of a lunch frorn a lard pail. I was starved and ate 
    all of the contents. There was a little can of cold beans, one of cold rice, a sandwich of bread and jelly,
    and a little spicecake. We had cool spring water to drink.</p>

    <p>What worried me was the absence of outside buildings. There was a pile of old shakes lying nearby which I eyed and 
    wondered if we could build some kind of an outside toilet. The next morning we brought tools and nails, and the 
    girls and I rigged up that building. By the end of the week, we were really organized, but I was completely done and decided 
    that if I were to continue there, I would have to have a horse. I braved it for another week. Having my trunk and 
    belongings lifted my morale a little, but by Friday night, as I took off my shoes and stockings to cross that 
    river, I was ready to give up. I perked up when we reached the homestead and we saw two saddled horses near the littlt barn.
    A girl whome I knew and who lived on a ranch with her mother, had come to take 
    me to my old, beloved school district for the weekend. In no time I was ready and off we went.</p>
    
    <p>The ride was delightful. I'll never forget it. I was to stay with my favorite family. It was near evening when we arrived, and 
    was it a joyous reunion. They had all planned a surprise for me, and that evening all the former children arrived. 
    It is as vivid to me now as it was then. How we talked and laughed, what a bontiful spread we had. Mrs. Hall had 
    baked our favorite custard pie - a deep one made with rich milk. It was a glorious weekend, but it ended, and I did 
    not see those people again. The term was short, and events happened one after another.</p>
    
    <p>While I was away, the trustee who met me at the depot on the wrong day and who was the father of the two little girls 
    who came to school riding double on the big old horse, had been to see the family with whom I boarded. They told him of my 
    need for a horse, and he came to my rescue by loaning me his oldest daughter's horse. She was away at school. He had kindly 
    brought it to the homestead. It was a beautiful young,  cream colored horse, and I was delighted.</p>
    
    <p>My mail came to Sherwood, and if we wanted mail, we had to go get it. I was so anxious to hear from home, so one beautiful 
    spring evening one of the girls, riding on a little jack, and I went into town. It was sometimes trip - a distance of six miles 
    over a narrow mountain trail - so narrow in some places that there was hardly room for the horse's feet. We had to that river 
    three times zig zagging back and forth. We went through some open country and a couple of cattle ranches before we reached the little 
    town. I wondered how I could ever make that trip alone, but it is amazing how fast one can learn when you have to.</p>

    <p>The little town of Sherwood then didn't consist of much more than a little general store, the depot, and a few scattered 
    houses. I remember I bought a bag of store candy for the children, and as they had a box of oranges, I got some of them to 
    take to the children also. I had quite a bit of mail, and with my purchases, was ready to start back. As my companion also 
    seemed ready to go, we started. By now it was quite dark, but that little jack led the way, and we arrived safely. I held my 
    breath a time or two!</p>

    <p>I did not realize until we reached the homestead and were inside the house that the little girl and the jack had a grocery 
    list to be filled at the small store in Sherwood. Her mother asked her why she didn't bring in everything. She didn't have 
    anything. It seems the logging company where the father worked also owned the little store, and he didn't have enough comming to 
    pay for the groceries. We lived the rest of the week on what the poor mother could provide. There seemed to be plenty of beans. 
    She didn't have baking powder or soda, but she contrived to make an edible plain spice cake by using a starter from her bread dough. 
    I paid her my board for the month, fifteen dollars, and the next weekend the supplies were purchased. A dollar went a long way in 
    those days.</p>

    <p>My horse, which seemed gentle enough at first, now began to get a little frisky. No doubt his own home and pasture were calling 
    him, for one morning when I got on him, he refused to go forward and proceeded to tilt me backward. The harder I tried, the worse 
    he bucked and tilted backward. The mother heard the commotion, ran out of the house, and grabbed his bridle, holding him until I 
    dismounted. I knew I could never trust him again, and I never tried. I was now afoot until a man whom I knew in my old school 
    district loaned me a nice, gentle horse. We got along just fine until one night when we had quite an experience. It happened 
    when we were on another Sherwood trip.</p> 
    <p>It was a gorgeous evening in the spring. One of the girls was with me on a little jack. We had to go by a little place owned 
    by an old man not far from the town. He had a little garden and a beautiful strawberry patch. I ordered a gallon of berries and 
    said we would pick them up on our way back. The stage, which went to points beyond Sherwood, had passed us, and someone had thrown 
    a paper away. Now, as it was later, the moon was out, the moonlight flickered through the pine trees, and a beam shone on this 
    paper in the road. We were galloping along and were almost at the beginning of our trail when this bright paper shone up in my 
    horse's eyes. It frightened him; he suddenly stopped, jumped forward, and threw me over his head and onto the bank. Away he went, 
    he was so scared. However, the little jack soon overtook him and brought him back. I had hit my face on the bank and broken off 
    all my front teeth. I was also shaken up and bruised, but I mounted the horse with blood running down from my mouth, and on we 
    went. We picked up the strawberries and finally reached the homestead after nearly slipping down twice when stepping on eels in 
    the river crossing. I wasn't afraid of that horse, as what happened wasn't his fault. However, his owner needed him - I was afoot 
    again but not for long."</p>

    <p>Dear friends from my former school district heard of my plight and brought over one of their horses for me to use, old Kaiser. 
    He was a stallion but gentle and safe to ride. We didn't feed the horses hay as there was always plenty of good grass on the 
    hillsides, but as Kaiser was not too young and I thought the grass was beginning to look a little sparse, I got a sack of oats 
    for him and fed him a little pan full each morning. I guess he was feeling pretty good, and I should have known better, but one 
    morning I was in a hurry to get started off to school and threw the saddle onto his back as I gave him his oats and proceeded to 
    cinch it up with my knee pressed against his stomach. He turned like lightning and sent me with all the force of his hind legs 
    to the edge of the bank overlooking the river. I had on a red skirt. By now the children came streaming out of the house with 
    their lunch pails and saw the red object lying there. By the time they reached me, I had regained my senses and, with their help, 
    got to the house. Mountain horses wore corks on their shoes to keep them from slipping on the steep mountain trails. Old Kaiser's 
    corks went clear through my clothes and into the flesh.</p>

    <p>I knew that I had to get to a doctor, but way up there in the wilderness, the only way I could get to Sherwood to get the train 
    to Ukiah to see a doctor was on the back of a horse for six miles over a narrow mountain trail. Girls were sent in opposite 
    directions to the nearest neighbors to get help. Before nightfall, every mountaineer within reasonable distance knew what had 
    happened. When my good friends who owned Kaiser heard, they came right over. They said they had a lovely mare who walked gently, 
    and they would bring her over to take me to Sherwood. The horse's name was Fly, a beautiful creature. The next morning, with much 
    effort, the kind people lifted me into the saddle. It was like being in a cradle; Fly stepped so gently. It was a long trip. 
    I gritted my teeth a number of times as I was really bruised. The doctor said I was lucky, for if those hind legs had struck me a 
    little higher or a little lower, it would have been quite critical. I was young and healthy, and with the doctor's care was able 
    to go back in about a week. The term was nearing the end, and Kaiser's owners thought they had better take him home and leave 
    Fly with me for the rest of the time, providing I would stay with them for a few days before leaving for home.</p>
        
    <p>About this time, the eldest daughter of the trustee on the faraway mountain had come home. She was a lovely girl of sixteen, 
    and we became great friends. I had promised to spend a night at their home, so one night after school I went home with the two 
    little girls. What a trip! We went up and down over a narrow trail until we came to a treacherous-looking river called Bloody Run. 
    There had been an Indian war party there, and the water had run red with blood. After crossing the river, we ascended a steep 
    mountain trail. The afternoon was far spent before we reached the house, or you might say the mountain ranch which was along the 
    ridge of the mountain. It was a revelation. There was a little orchard, a small hay field, a vegetable garden, a barn, the house, 
    and the outbuildings. All were made of shakes as they could not haul lumber up there. The floors in the house were the good 
    mother earth pounded down good and hard. There was a big rock fireplace at one end of what I would now call the family room. 
    There was a big roaring fire in the fireplace, and its warmth was wonderful.</p>

    <p>Darkness had fallen by the time we had dinner, a meal that will always stand out in my memory. The long table was adorned with 
    a red checkered tablecloth, and a lamp sat in the center. What stands out most from the menu is the delicious young fried turkey 
    and little green onions from their garden.</p>

    <p>The next morning, as we emerged out of the house, I lifted my eyes to the heavens. I had never seen a more beautiful sight. We were 
    up so high, the morning was so clear, the sky so blue, and you could almost see the Pacific Ocean fifty miles away. It was all a 
    memorable experience.</p>

    <p>We were now on the last week of school, and it was the usual busy time. I had learned a lot about rural life, had my share of 
    harrowing experiences mingled with pleasant ones, but I was not returning. I had decided that I had had enough of roughing 
    it and was ready for the new term—to apply for a city school.</p>
        
     <p>But - I must tell you of my last experience. By Friday night, I was ready to leave the homestead. The little jacks were to 
    take my trunk to Sherwood the next day, and the few belongings I kept out were to be tied on Fly's saddle on my journey over 
    to spend a couple of days with my good friends, the owners of Kaiser and Fly. I didn't get away as early as expected, and before 
    I had covered half the distance, it was pitch dark. I knew the way, and so did Fly. We had to go through the property of a resort 
    which was only used for hunting, and it was not yet open for the season. We were making good time until we reached the barn of 
    the property, and I had to dismount to open a gate attached to one corner of the barn and the fence. As I took hold of Fly's 
    bridle to lead her through the gate, she rubbed against a package which was tied to the back of the saddle. This frightened her, 
    and she bolted from me and disappeared in the darkness. To this day I can hear her hoofs speeding away from me. I knew I couldn't 
    catch her in the darkness. I also knew the property was fenced in. I didn't know the extent of the land but knew Fly was in the 
    enclosure somewhere. I was frantic with the thought that if she rolled trying to free herself of the saddle, she might get 
    injured, or if it rained, everything I had tied to the saddle would be soaked. Every conceivable thing went through my brain, 
    but I knew that I couldn't stay there by the barn. Besides, all those dark empty buildings were getting pretty spooky. So, 
    I fastened the gate and started on foot. I knew where the next gate was, and if I bore to the left, I might be able to find it. 
    Fortunately, to my relief, I reached that gate. I had hoped Fly might be there, but she wasn't. The rest of the way to the ranch 
    gave me no trouble as, instead of a trail, there was a rough road which followed along a creek almost to my destination. It was 
    way past midnight when I pounded on the farmhouse door. As I hadn't arrived by nightfall, the folks had given me up. They tried 
    to quell my fears about Fly and said she would be found in the morning. I finally crawled into bed. I guess because I was so 
    utterly exhausted, I slept, only to be awakened by good news. The hired man had gone early in search of Fly and found her waiting 
    at the gate with everything intact.</p>
    
    <p>I was anxious to get home, but if I remember correctly, I spent a couple of days with these dear friends and had the experience 
    of going deer hunting "mountain style out of season". We set out on horseback one morning around four o'clock in search of our 
    own game. We hadn't gone far when we saw two beautiful bucks across a little canyon. One was killed, and, as it was illegal at 
    this time of year to do so, my friend took out the liver and hoisted the rest of the animal to a hiding place in a large old oak 
    tree until the dark of evening when he went back to retrieve it. The next day, I left for home.</p>

     <p>I taught in my hometown of Martinez until I married, serving as Principal of the Grammar Department and teaching an eighth 
        grade. Every class was outstanding and a great pleasure.</p>   
        
     <p>This is a rough sketch of my early teaching experiences.</p>

    <p><h3>Postscript</h3></p>

    <p>The dear friends who owned Kaiser and Fly and were so kind to me were Dan and Wardie Groscup. Through them, I met two boys named 
    Woodhead who lived nearer the coast in the midst of the redwood area. One was twenty-one, and the other was a lovable chap of 
    sixteen. They invited me and Wardie to spend a weekend with their parents, so one weekend we saddled up our horses and went over 
    there. I'll never forget those beautiful redwoods and that visit. At that time, there was plenty of valuable land in California 
    opened to anyone to homestead by living on it so many years and "proving up" on it. I don't know how many of the people living in 
    the area acquired their property this way, but the area was all ideal.</p>

    <p>This part of Northern California abounded in mineral springs, both hot and cold. Just before we reached the Woodhead home, we 
    left the road a few yards to drink from an ice-cold soda water spring. Many a time after that, I added a little lemon juice and 
    sugar to a dipper of that water. What a drink! That evening before dark, we rode up the side of the mountain to a flat spot, where 
    we saw bubbling hot mud flowing from a number of springs. Nearby there were cattle grazing, and on the way back, we saw several 
    deer.</p>
    
    <p>The next day, while visiting in the living room, a young woman came in. She had a baby in her arms, and beside her were a 
    little toddler about two years of age and a boy approximately nine or ten. They were the wife and children of the oldest Woodhead 
    son and were living on their place a mile or so further along the mountain while he was a guard at Folsom Prison. She had been 
    visiting her parents, the Hahns, who lived a couple of miles in the other direction. Her father and brothers had a sawmill in 
    the depth of the redwoods.</p>
    
    <p>The Hahn home was on a mountainside above the mill, and it was one of the most beautiful spots you could ever see. Quite an 
    acreage was fenced in; the big barn and outbuildings were painted red, and the house white. In the back were a lovely orchard and 
    vineyard. A little farther on was another little enclosure with a little white chapel and the family burial ground. I have been 
    there many times, now so long ago, as we became great friends.</p>
    
    <p>My family and I spent many happy vacations camping on the Hahn property. I can see it now, the beautiful trees and the little, 
    ice-cold brook flowing at the side of the camp. We didn't need an icebox. As the years passed, the children grew, and while we 
    were in camp, they would spend several nights with their grandparents so that they could join us in the evening to enjoy the 
    campfire and the fun.</p>
    
    <p>I will close my narrative with the important part. That little toddler who was with her mother the first time I saw her was 
    Mary Josephine Woodhead. She has been my beloved sister-in-law for nearly fifty years, as she married my brother, Bill. The baby 
    in her mother's arms was Esther Woodhead, and she is the wife of another toddler of that time, Carl Groscup, the son of Wardie 
    and Dan Groscup.</p>
