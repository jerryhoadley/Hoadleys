                    <p>"Spare the rod and spoil the child?" Dad closely resembled his father in looks and appearance but inherited 
                        a more moderate disposition from his mother, though he had a hot temper on occasion.</p>
     
                    <p>William Carlyle White was born in or near Paisley, Scotland. He learned the weaver’s trade there and married. 
                    He came to America (year unknown) with his wife and oldest son. William was a southerner, and according to my dad, 
                    he quarreled with his family and took his mother’s maiden name of "White". He would never tell the family name, 
                    but my dad always wanted to go to Scotland to try to 
                    trace it.</p>

                    <p>William had a boyhood chum named Campbell to whom he loaned money. Both men were younger sons. Later, through 
                    the death of older brothers, Campbell inherited a large estate including investments in Scotland and America, and 
                    more particularly cotton mills at Clarks Mills, New York. Campbell offered the position of superintendent in these 
                    mills to William White, who accepted it and lived for many years in Clarks Mills. Dad does not know the year in 
                    which his father left Scotland.</p>

                    <p>William White’s first wife died in 1843 when twin children were born. He married Lovica Harrington a year later. 
                    After his second marriage, his mother came to Clarks Mills and died there in 1854. Dad remembers her death; 
                    he was four years old. I should think the name could be obtained from records there.</p>

                    <p>In 1855, William bought a farm of rough, uncleared land near Parish, New York. He wished to remove his family 
                    from the factory town. Half of the land was forest and the rest covered with snow when he bought it in mid-winter. 
                    Come spring, it was discovered that much of the land was covered with rocks. Dad remembers vividly how they piled 
                    rock fences for years, slowly clearing the land. As the children grew older, they left home, many returning to the 
                    mills</p>

                    <p>William Carlyle White died in 1879 and is buried at Dugway, near Parish. He was an Episcopalian but attended the 
                    Presbyterian church when his own was not available. William was very autocratic, reserved, and aristocratic. Dad can 
                    never remember his father comorting any of his children; he thoroughly believed "Spare the rod and spoil the child". 
                    Dad closely resembled his father in looks and appearance, but inherited a more moderate disposition from his mother, 
                    though he had a hot temper on occasion.</p>
