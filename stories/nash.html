                    <p>Captain Robert Nash was Captain of a regiment from Wisconsin during the Civil War. He was taken ill and 
                    was on his way home on furlough when he died. He and Catherine (Craven) Nash had eight children - Sarah, Susan, 
                    Catherine, <b>Alta Belle</b>, George, Life, Charles, and Frank.</p>   

                     <p>Two years after Robert Nash's death, his widow married Life Farmer, an old family friend. They, with 
                    their youngest child, <b>Alta Belle</b> (five years old), moved to California, sailing around the Horn. 
                    Mr. Farmer had asthma and moved into several climates for his health, They lived in Truckee, Independence Lake, 
                    Potter Valley, and finally Cloverdale, where they lived out their lives. Both Mr. and Mrs. Farmer are buried 
                    in Riverside Cemetery, Cloverdale.</p>

                    <p>Sarah, the eldest child, was grown when her father died. She married George Daigh, a farmer in Illinois. 
                    They had eleven children. The youngest, Ethel Turley, now lives in San Diego. She is a widow. She was married 
                    to Earl Turley, and they had five children.</p>

                    <p>Susan (second daughter) married Eugene Everett Holbrook, and they lived in Alden, Iwoa. He became a 
                    "consumptive" (Tuberculosis - a serious illness that mainly affects the lungs) and came out to California for 
                    his health. He died in Potter Valley. He and Susan had two little boys, Robert and Leland, and a third little 
                    boy, Eugene Everett, born two days after the father's death. Susan came to Potter Valley with the Children. 
                    Robert died. Leland became a cripple, but she raised Eugene to manhood. Susan later married William Wilson, 
                    a merchant in Potter Valley. They had two children, William and Catherine. Eugene, Susan's son, married Frances 
                    Busch of Potter Valley. They lived in Ukiah the years that Eugene was County Recorder of Mendocino County. 
                    There were three children, Nina, Helene, and Eugene Everett, now all of Crescent City. Nina married Ray Carlen. 
                    Helene married Edwin Harrison and has one daughter. Both Nina and Helene are now widows.</p>
                    
                    <p>I know nothing abouth the Nash boys except Frank, who never married and lived in San Francisco. He died 
                    in Brentwood in 1923, was cremated at the Chapel of Chimes in Oakland, and his ashes taken to Cloverdale 
                    (by my father and Frank Harris) and burried in the Farmer plot.</p>
                
                    <p><b>Alta Belle married James Francis Hoadley Jr.</b> in Cloverdale October 16, 1881. They had six children Elias 
                    Augustus, James Francis, Harriet, Gladys, Charles, and William. Elias Augustus died in Cloverdale January 12, 1887, 
                    aged 4 years. Gladys died in Martinez November 29, 1909, aged 21 years. Charles died in Martinez July 28, 1928,

                    <p>The father of our subject, Eugene Evert Hollbrook Jr., was born in Smelsers Grove, Grant County, Wisconsin 
                    and later in life was a merchant and farmer in Alden, Iowa. After a severe attack of pneumonia he was compelled 
                    in 1871 to come to California for his health. Leaving his family to settle up his affairs he came to Potter Valley 
                    in May of that year, but he had waited too long before coming, for he died August 10th, following two days after 
                    the birth of the son who was named for him.</p>
                    
                    <p>The father of E. E. Holbrook, Sr., was Dr. Ora L. Holbrook, a practicing physician in Smelsers Grove, 
                    Wisconsin, and his first wife was Louise Hayes, the daughter of ex-President Rutherford B. Hayes. Mrs. Holbrook was 
                    before her marriage Susie Nash, a native of Illinois. As soon as it was possible to dispose of her affairs after 
                    the death of her husband, she brought her family to Potter Valley in May, 1873, that being the home of her Mother 
                    and Step-Father, Life Farmer. Mrs. Holbrook's father, Robert Nash, served in the Civil War as a Captain in a 
                    Wisconsin regiment and lost his life in service. His widow subsequently became the wife of Life Farmer. She passed 
                    away at Cloverdale.</p>
                     
                    <p>Mrs. Holbrook resided with Mr. and Mrs. Farmer until her second marriage, to William Wilson, after which they 
                    engaged in the Merchandise business in Potter Valley until their retirement to Ukiah, where they now live. 
                    Three children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Holbrook, Sr., and one of these, our subject, is the only one living. 
                    He was born in Alden, Iowa, August 8, 1871, and has lived in California since 1873, his earliest recollections 
                    being of Mendocino County.</p>

                    <p>The history of the Holbrook family can be traced back to the early settlement of Pennsylvania, while the 
                    Nash family came from Virginia.</p>
