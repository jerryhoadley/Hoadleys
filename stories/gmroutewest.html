          and a ham, which they took and we passed along. That was before we got in company with Pierson and there were but \

          Trail zig zagged back and forth across the Sweetwater River. First there was Three Crossings, and beyond that\
          Ice Slough Creek emptied into the river, and next came St. Mary\'s Crossing, then at the next junction at Burnt \
          Ranch the "Landers Road" took off for the north, while the Mormon Trail continued on through South Pass after leaving\
          Sweetwater River at Burnt Ranch.Next came Pacific Springs, then the following creeks had to be crossed, Pacific \
          Creek, Dry Sandy,Little Sandy, and Big Sandy. It was between Dry Sandy and the Little Sandy that the Mormon Trail \
          separated from joint Mormon and Oregon-California Trail and headed toward Fort Bridger and Salt Lake, while the \
          Oregon-California Trail continued over "Sublette\'s Cut-Off" to a Ferry at the Green River, then continuing on past \
          "Names Hill" then on to Sublet and over State and Crow Creeks past Aspen Grove and over Rock Creek, then on to \
          Cokeville.\ \
          Now the Trail turns northwest crossing over Smith \'s Fork and Thomas Fork of the Bear River and the Trail now leads \
          into Idaho. Then comes Montpelier, Georgetown, and Soda Springs on the northside of the Bear River. Leaving the Bear \
          River the trail continues on through Alexan- der(in 1853 it rained every day but one from South Pass to the Bear River, \
          such being the nature of this Rocky Mountain country) and at this point on the Trail the Bidwell-Bartelson party \
          in 1841- the first to reach California overland from the U.S.- turned and headed south- west, whereas for the next few \
          years most wagons following the Oregon Trail headed northwest for Fort Hall and then following the Snake River in a \
          southwesterly direction. However, at a later time and caused by the gold seekers, a new route was established in 1849 \
          and became the main route to follow- known as "Hudspeth\'s Cut-Off". \
          er which Dempsey Creek had to be crossed, then came Arimo near Marsh Creek followed by Bannock Creek and Arbor passing \
          through Curlew Valley and by Rock Springs then over Sublette Creek followed by crossing Raft River and then following \
          Cassia Creek to Elba. The Trail then continues south to the City of Rocks and Junction Valley and then continues on \
          through Granite Pass and follows Birch Creek to the junction of Goose Creek and leaves the Idaho-Utah border and heads \
          through a very short piece of the Trail in the very top port- ion of the northwest corner of Utah before entering Nevada.\
          \
          The City of Rocks is considered a sort of geographical hub for the California Trail. The Trail follows Goose Creek \
          into Nevada and intersects and crosses Little Goose Creek then follows Rock Springs and Emigrant Springs located near \
          the banks of Rock Springs Creek, which the Trail follows southwest until it meets up with 1000 Springs Creek, which it \
          now follows south. Bearing east while traveling south the Trail divides, some taking Town Creek to Wells, and others \
          taking Bishop Creek to Deeth ( I must digress for the moment- for my Dad railroad- ed through Deeth, Nevada- and said\
          it was the coldest place on earth, for they never stopped there during Winter, for if they did, the wheels would freeze\
           to the tracks. Said that the ranchers filled the fields, where their cattle were grazing with enough hay to last the \
           winter, and it was kept almost up to their eyeballs, for it was necessary to keep their milk from turning to ice \
           cream-that\'s cold!) Between Deeth and Elko, the North Fork of the Humboldt River joins the East Fork of the same \
           river to become the infamous Humboldt River, which caused much loss of life and hardship for both humans. and animals.\
           Between Elko and Greenhorn\'s Cut-Off the South Fork of the Humboldt joins the Humboldt River, which is where the \
           Bidwell Trail of 1841 and Hasting\'s Cut-Off joined the California Trail. After passing by Fremont\'s Canyon, next \
           comes Carlin and then Emigrant Spring. It was at this point that some of the trains chose to cross the Humboldt at \
           Gravelly Ford and continue west on the southside of the river. However, many trains heading for northern California \
           remained on the northside of the river. Thus continuing on, in a westerly direction, from Emigrant Springs, comes \
           Dunphy and then past to the south of Stony Point, then came Tutt\'s Meadow and Red House, next Winnemucca. Later on \
           the Great or Lassen Mead- ow was reached and became the junction to turn off and continue in a northwesterly direction \
           on what became known as the Applegate- Lassen Route. This route was taken to a point opposite the present towns of \
           Mill City and Imlay on U.S. Route #80. The route continued north of Rye Patch Reservoir in a westerly direction \
           through Antel- ope Spring between Majuba Mountain to the south and Antelope Range to the north. The Appelgate-Lassen \
           Route continued up to the Imlay Summit and Rosebud Canyon, whereas Noble\'s Route followed south of that route and \
           through the Kamma Mountains, both meeting at a junc- tion called Rabbit Hole Springs where Noble\'s Route left the \
           Apple- gate-Lassen Route, and went on its own, having been established in 1851- two years prior to the Hoadleys coming \
           west, and in 1852 the first Emigrants started using this new route, which ran from the Applegate-Lassen Trail at the \
           Great Boiling Springs at Black Rock Point to Shasta City, California, by way of the Smoke Creek Desert and Lassen Peak.'
