    <p><b>PREFACE</b></p>

    <p>Ever since the beginning of the Hoadley Genealogy became a project of mine, and the farther that I delved into it, the more 
    curious I became, as I wondered what route our Great-Grandfather James Francis Hoadley took West, from Hartland, Vermont to Lewiston, 
    California.</p>
    <p> Now, we do know, from all that we have read and heard, that James Francis Hoadley and his bride Harriet Celestial Appleby 
    Hoadley came across the Plains in a wagon by what route, is something that we do not know, but can only conjecture.</p> 
    <p>I have read several books, and most, in the main, furnished in essence the same conclusions. Roads or highways, as we know of 
    them today, 
    were non-existent. There were, of course, roads between towns on the East coast, but for distance travel, rivers were used mostly, 
    and if wagons were the source of travel, they usually traveled alongside the rivers or the ridges above. The crossing of rivers 
    always caused some problems, but they were not insurmountable, it was the numerous creeks encountered along the way that caused 
    much of the distress, because of their narrowness and depth. The wagons were not equipped with any type of braking system, which 
    required wheels to be chained to each other, and/or fallen trees chained to the rear wheels to act as a drag, when the wagons were 
    eased down hills or a mountainside.</p> 
    <p>How James Francis 
    Hoadley traveled from Hartland, Vermont to Springfield, Pennsylvania, where he met and married Harriet Celestial Appleby, and how they 
    traveled from Springfield to the jumping off places. For the West, which in this case is known to be Council Bluffs, Iowa on the Missouri 
    River (as told to the writer by Harriet Louise Hoadley). Harris-who said she was so advised by Harriet Celestial Hoadley. However, if we 
    follow the usual wagon routes which had become pretty well established between 1841 and 1853, the latter being the year that the Hoadleys 
    started West, we can fairly well establish the route they might have taken. I am setting up a route that I think might apply, however 
    each reader may wish to lay out what he or she thinks is the route that applies. In order to do this, it will require some maps from Iowa to 
    the Pacific Coast, and the following are books that I have referred to, and which I found to be most helpful and I heartily recommend;</p>

    <p>James Francis Hoadley, at age 19 in 1850 left his home located in Hartland, Windsor County, Vermont. His Father had passed away when 
        James was twelve years of age. His Mother was sixty at the time of his departure.</p>
    
    <p>He headed for Erie County, Pennsylvania, and it is pure assumption but that he may have traveled West through Vermont and New York 
        to Lake Ontario, then southwest after leaving Niagara Falls, New York to Erie County, Pennsylvania, where he met and wooed Harriet 
        Celestial Appleby, who had been born in Springfield, Pennsylvania, which is now located in upper central Pennsylvania directly below 
        the New York border east of #14 and north of #6 in Bradford County.</p>

    <p>They were married in Harriet's home town of Springfield, when he was 21 and she was 20. They then moved to Jefferson County in Wisconsin, 
        assuming again that they may have traveled down Lake Erie and crossed the lower part of Michigan and over to the town of Whitewater, 
        Wisconsin, where his brother George Clinton Hoadley, D.D.S. resided. </p>

     <p>Our TV and Movies have always pictured the Emigrants rolling West in large cumbersome Conestoga Wagons, drawn by a team of horses. 
        Horses are rarely used to today, only to ride, but the wagons, which were used were of lighter manufacture, and were drawn usually 
        by six Mules or Oxen, preferably Oxen.</p>   

     <p>What kind of people were our Great-grandparents? The answer may be found in some of the subject matter, referred to in the Preface.</p>   

     <p>They were indeed a special extraordinarily tough breed of people, taking part in one of the truly heroic events in human history. If 
        they had to throw away everything of value and sentiment, from their past back in the States in order to win out over desert sands, 
        they did it, regretful but resolute, they did it. If they had to tear down a wagon completely and carry it piece by piece to the top 
        of a mountain, where it was reassembled to continue the journey, well, they did just that. By the will and vitality and courage of the 
        Emigrants, and we have constantly marveled at the physical endurance and accomplishments. To continue on was an act of faith.</p>   

     <p>Just who were these Emigrants? They were basically family units who were farmers mostly, merchants and professional men going West 
        with the idea of sticking with it and building a new life for themselves and their children.</p>   

     <p>The Mormon Trail was established in 1847, after the Mormons having established themselves in Commerce, Illinois and changed the name to 
        Nauvoo in 1840, but were driven out of there in 1845. After 1850 the Mormons kept to the northside of the Platte River pretty 
        consistently, but the people bound for the coast used both roads, the Mormon and the Oregon. About a third of the West Coasters 
        took the Mormon Trail. Oregon Trail is the usual term for the northern fork and the entire trail from the Missouri along the north 
        bank of the Platte and over the mountains to Salt Lake City, is called the Mormon Trail, but they are coincidental over the Rockies 
        where the many people headed for California used the trail.</p>    

     <p>We may assume that the Hoadleys left James' brother Dr. George Clinton Hoadley at Whitewater, Wisconsin and headed for the beginning 
        of the Mormon Trail. By traveling west from Whitewater they could have reached Rock River shortly thereafter, and followed it in its 
        southwesterly direction through Illinois, to where it joins the Mississippi River at the State borders of Illinois and Iowa, and if 
        going by water they could have continued down the Mississippi River to St.Louis, Missouri, where they could have transferred to a boat 
        on the Missouri River, which would ply westward across the State of Missouri and then turn north at Kansas City, past St.Joseph to the 
        starting off place for the Mormon Trail at Council Bluffs, Iowa, otherwise it would have been necessary to travel over 300 miles, as 
        the crow flies, by wagon across the State of Iowa, a long and tedious task.</p>   

     <p>At Council Bluffs, Iowa (formerly Kanesville) the Missouri River must be crossed into Nebraska onto the Mormon Trail. Beginning, the 
        trail crosses Papillon Creek, Elkhorn River, Rawhide Creek to the town of Fremont on the northside of the Platte River. Across Shell 
        Creek, across the Loup River, on the Loup Ferry to the town of Fullerton at Prairie Creek, continuing down the northside of the Platte,
        past Grand Island near Wood River, then on to Gothenburg and next Maxwell which was a mite south of the trail. Quite a distance ahead 
        on the northside of the North Platte, along the Mormon Trail comes Lemoyne, Lone Tree, Lewellen, Bayard and Scottsbluff still in 
        Nebraska, but now heading into Wyoming.</p>   

        <p>The first town to pass in Wyoming, is Torrington, then Guernsey. Between Scottsbluff and Guernsey, Fort Laramie is located, this 
        being where mail along the Trail could be posted, and carried back by those returning eastward. It was at this place that Nathan 
        Aldrich on May 27, 1852 mailed a letter to his wife "Some companies have had trouble with the Pawnias (Pawnee) Indians having their
         provisions taken away and in some cases their cows shot full of arrows so they would have to be left, and two white men wounded by 
         them, one thought to be mortally, but we got along with them remarkably well on account of the Chief being a Mason, and Mr. Brown 
         gave him the sign, which was answered by the Chief and there was a small boy that could talk English and Mr. Brown told him we had 
         no more provisions than would do us on our journey and if they would let us pass we would give them a sack of corn and a ham, which 
         they took and we passed along. That was before we got in company with Pierson and there were but four wagons of us together at the 
         time and there were about two hundred of the Indians placed upon both sides of the road with their bows and arrows."</p> 

         <p>From Guernsey there is quite a distance to Douglas, then Casper. Just beyond Casper the Platte Bridge was located and it was at this 
        junction that the Oregon Trail and sometimes called the California Trail, having as their points of departure, either at 
        Independence, St.Joseph or St. Louis, Missouri, left the North Platte River and joined the Mormon Trail which continued on 
        over Poison Spider Creek through Willow Springs and then crossed to the southside of Sweetwater River near Independence Rock. Here 
        at this place was held the first masonic meeting in Wyoming, certainly it was an isolated and appropriate spot, something not so 
        easy to find around the populous camps, and on July 4, 1862, about twenty Oregon-bound Masons utilized its privacy to conduct Lodge.</p>

        <p>After Independence Rock and Devil's Gate, the next stop was at Sun's Ranch Stage Station. The Trail zig zagged back and forth 
        across the Sweetwater River. First there was Three Crossings, and beyond that Ice Slough Creek emptied into the river, and next 
        came St. Mary's Crossing, then at the next junction at Burnt Ranch the "Landers Road" took off for the north, while the Mormon 
        Trail continued on through South Pass after leaving Sweetwater River at Burnt Ranch. Next came Pacific Springs, then the following 
        creeks had to be crossed, Pacific Creek, Dry Sandy,Little Sandy, and Big Sandy. It was between Dry Sandy and the Little Sandy 
        that the Mormon Trail separated from joint Mormon and Oregon-California Trail and headed toward Fort Bridger and Salt Lake, while 
        the Ore- gon-California Trail continued over "Sublette's Cut-Off" to a Ferry at the Green River, then continuing on past 
        "Names Hill" then on to Sublet and over State and Crow Creeks past Aspen Grove and over Rock Creek, then on to Cokeville.</p> 
        
        <p>Now the Trail turns northwest crossing over Smith's Fork and Thomas Fork of the Bear River and the Trail now leads into Idaho. Then 
        comes Montpelier, Georgetown, and Soda Springs on the northside of the Bear River. Leaving the Bear River the trail continues on 
        through Alexander (in 1853 it rained every day but one from South Pass to the Bear River, such being the nature of this Rocky 
        Mountain country) and at this point on the Trail the Bidwell-Bartelson party in 1841 (the first to reach California overland from 
        the U.S.) turned and headed southwest, whereas for the next few years most wagons following the Oregon Trail headed northwest for 
        Fort Hall and then following the Snake River in a southwesterly direction. However, at a later time and caused by the gold seekers, 
        a new route was established in 1849 and became the main route to follow, known as "Hudspeth's Cut-Off".</p> 
        
        <p>After leaving Alexander, the Trail led through Lund, then Lava Hot Springs after which Dempsey Creek had to be crossed, then 
        came Arimo near Marsh Creek followed by Bannock Creek and Arbor passing through Curlew Valley and by Rock Springs then over 
        Sublette Creek followed by crossing Raft River and then following Cassia Creek to Elba. The Trail then continues south to the 
        City of Rocks and Junction Valley and then continues on through Granite Pass and follows Birch Creek to the junction of Goose 
        Creek and leaves the Idaho-Utah border and heads through a very short piece of the Trail in the very top portion of the northwest 
        corner of Utah before entering Nevada.</p> 

        The City of Rocks is considered a sort of geographical hub for the California Trail.</p>

        <p>The Trail follows Goose Creek into Nevada and intersects and crosses Little Goose Creek then follows Rock Springs and Emigrant 
        Springs located near the banks of Rock Springs Creek, which the Trail follows southwest until it meets up with 1000 Springs Creek, 
        which it now follows south. Bearing east while traveling south the Trail divides, some taking Town Creek to Wells, and others taking 
        Bishop Creek to Deeth (I must digress for the moment) for my Dad railroaded through Deeth, Nevada, and said it was the coldest 
        place on earth, for they never stopped there during Winter, for if they did, the wheels would freeze to the tracks. Said that the 
        ranchers filled the fields, where their cattle were grazing with enough hay to last the winter, and it was kept almost up to their 
        eyeballs, for it was necessary to keep their milk from turning to ice cream. That's cold!</p> 

        <p>Between Deeth and Elko, the North Fork of the Humboldt River joins the East Fork of the same river to become the infamous Humboldt 
        River, which caused much loss of life and hardship for both humans and animals. Between Elko and Greenhorn's Cut-Off the South Fork 
        of the Humboldt joins the Humboldt River, which is where the Bidwell Trail of 1841 and Hasting's Cut-Off joined the California Trail.
        After passing by Fremont's Canyon, next comes Carlin and then Emigrant Spring. It was at this point that some of the trains chose 
        to cross the Humboldt at Gravelly Ford and continue west on the southside of the river. However, many trains heading for northern 
        California remained on the northside of the river. Thus continuing on, in a westerly direction, from Emigrant Springs, comes Dunphy 
        and then past to the south of Stony Point, then came Tutt's Meadow and Red House ascend next Winnemucca. Later on the Great or Lassen 
        Meadow was reached and became the junction to turn off and continue in a northwesterly direction on what became known as the 
        Applegate - Lassen Route. This route was taken to a point opposite the present towns of Mill City and Imlay on U.S. Route #80. 
        The route continued north of Rye Patch Reservoir in a westerly direction through Antel- ope Spring between Majuba Mountain to the 
        south and Antelope Range to the north. The Appelgate-Lassen Route continued up to the Imlay Summit and Rosebud Canyon, whereas 
        Noble's Route followed south of that route and through the Kamma Mountains, both meeting at a junction called Rabbit Hole Springs 
        where Noble's Route left the Applegate-Lassen Route, and went on its own, having been established in 1851, two years prior to 
        the Hoadleys coming west, and in 1852 the first Emigrants started using this new route, which ran from the Applegate-Lassen Trail 
        at the Great Boiling Springs at Black Rock Point to Shasta City, California, by way of the Smoke Creek Desert and Lassen Peak.</p> 
        
        <p>The original Noble's Trail followed the Applegate-Lassen Route to the Great Boiling Springs at Black Rock Point. It then cut 
        westward across a finger of Black Rock Desert and dropped south along the eastern base of the Granite Range to water and grass 
        at Granite Springs. From there it proceeded past the Hot Springs at Gerlach (discovered by Fremont in 1844) and rounded the point 
        of the Granite Range to move along the watering places on the western edge of the Smoke Creek Desert.</p> 
        
        <p>The emigrant next wound up Smoke Creek Canyon to the lower end of Smoke Creek Meadows and thence westward over the low divide 
        into the Valley of Rush Creek, which put the emigrant into California and on the last leg toward his destination. The next stop was to 
        the south and west at Mud Springs and then on to Honey Lake Valley and the Susan River at Susanville. The trail left Susanville 
        (first known as Roop's Fort) to the northwest and climbed through dense pines and cedars to Feather Lake, where it met the Lassen 
        Trail. Then the trail continued northwest past Lodgepole to Gray's Valley and Poison Lake, and then it turned westward to Butte 
        Creek and up the Creek to Butte Lake and Black Butte (Cinder Cone). Volcanic sands made the next few miles west to Badger Flat. 
        Hard going, but then the trail turned up Hat Creek through forests and meadows.</p> 

        <p>At the base of Lassen Peak, the route turned north, down Lost Creek and then west over the first named Noble's Pass to Manzanita 
        Lake. Very soon, a detour, to avoid difficult roads and lingering snows, was opened from a point just beyond Badger Flat, and it 
        struck off down Hat Creek to Emigrant Ford before swinging over to Lost Creek and around Table Mountain to ascend the second Noble's
        Pass and rejoin the original route at the Manzanita Chute below Manzanita Lake. From that point, the trail dropped down through 
        Deer Flat, Mountain Home, McCumbers on Mill Seat Creek, Grace Lake, Shingle <Tem></Tem>own, Shingle Creek, Lack Creek,Bear Creek, Cow Creek, 
        the Sacramento River near Fort Reading, and Shasta City.</p> 
        
        <p>Noble's Route lasted through the 1850's and 1860's, bringing many wagon trains and cattle drives to the upper Sacramento 
        region.</p> 

        <p>The Hoadleys continued west to Louis's Town (later renamed Lewiston), where they located on Patented Land, at the base of two 
        Peaks located at the lower end of the Trinity Alps. <b>These Peaks are now officially named Hoadley Peaks</b>, and although not high 
        in elevation (4584 Feet) according to western standards, their height is taller than any of the mountains in Vermont, where James 
        Francis Hoadley Started from.
