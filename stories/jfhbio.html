                    <h3>Thomas Hoadley - Elias Hoadley -  James F. Hoadley</h3>
                    <div class="row">    
                    <p>Thomas Hoadley, born in one of two parishes in Sussex, East and West Hoathly, in the area of Lewes 
                    or that of Pevensey, in 1737, where the Celtic name for Hoadley was Haffacunga Leigh ("A dweller 
                    on the edge of the heath"). He emigrated to America, and at age 23 in 1760 married Mary Stone, from which 
                    union, emerged seven children, five boys and two girls. The third son was Elias, born in 1770.</p>

                    <p>Five years later, when Thomas was 38 years of age and with five children to support, enlisted 
                    18 June 1775 at Tewksbury, Mass as a Private in Captain Samual Joy's Company in Colonel Bridge's Regiment 
                    in the Massachusetts Line. He enlisted again in April 1776, as a Private in Captain Samuel Joy's Company 
                    in General Gates Brigade in the Massachusetts Line in the Continental establishment. He then enlisted for 
                    the third time, for one year in May of 1778, instead of as the other two enlistments which whereas of nine months 
                    duration, with Captain Lane and Col. Nixon - ending his enlistment 19 March 1779.</p>

                    <p>After the war he removed with his family to Hartland, Windsor County, Vermont, where he bought a 
                    farm on which he lived the remainder of his life. His wife Mary died there 13 June 1818, aged 80 years. 
                    He died there 20 June 1829, aged 92 years. Elias Hoadley, the third son of Thomas, at age 23 married 
                    Sarah French, with whom they had seven children, five boys and tree girls. Sarah died in 1816, and Elias 
                    remarried to Mehitable Marcy Whitney, with whom they had five boys and three girls the fourth son being 
                    <b>James Francis Hoadley</b>, whom this story is all about.</p>

                    <p>James Francis Hoadley established a trading post, and packed his goods from Shasta over Trinity Mountain 
                    on mules until 1858, then he closed that out and built a saw mill, powered by the stream from Hoadley 
                    Creek, which had gushed down Hoadley Gulch and empties into the Trinity River, and carried on a small 
                    farm.</p>

                    <p>Issac Cox's Annals of Trinity County, published in 1858 stated on page 19: "At the head of the (Louiston) 
                    basin is (the) Mud Ranch... Adjoining this is Hoadley's, a large garden, a tavern and a post-office, 
                    all kept by the gentleman whose name it bears."</p> 

                    <p>In the summer of 1865 he helped to build a toll road from Tower House in Shasta County to Lewiston. After 
                    two years he became the owner of the toll road, and then completed it to Weaverville in Trinity County. 
                    In the meantime, over the years Mrs. Hoadley had earned her 'pin money' by sewing for miners who were seeking 
                    gold on the Trinity River. While here Mr. Hoadley held the office of Supervisor for two terms, and that of 
                    Justice of Peace one term  and was Postmaster for four years.</p> 

                    <p>His younger brother Elias Augustus Hoadley had followed James, arriving a year later in 1854 moving 
                    to Happy Camp in Siskiyou County, where he mined for gold and later married Dr. Kate Nach, a Karok Indian 
                    lady. His immediate older brother, Dr. George Clinton Hoadley, later moved from Wisconsin to establish 
                    his Dentistry practice in San Francisco where he also established the first Dental Supply House 
                    now known as Edwards Dental Supply.</p>

                    <p>Mr. James Francis Hoadley sold his land in 1872 to John Taylor and Elisha Dack, for four thousand dollars.</p>
                   
                    <p>James Francis Hoadley, was born at Hartland, Windsor County, Vermont 16 August 1831, spending his 
                    educational years close by, and apprenticed himself to learn the Carpenter's trade. At 19 years of age he 
                    left home for Erie County, Pennsylvania, where he remained for about two years, and where he met and wooed 
                    and married Harriet Celestial Appleby, of Pennsylvania Dutch extraction, in Springfield, Erie County, 
                    Pennsylvania 3 November 1852. The newlyweds then moved to Whitewater, Jefferson County, Wisconsin, near 
                    James older brother Dr. George Clinton Hoadley, a practicing Dentist.</p>

                    <p>In the spring of 1853, they set out to cross the plains, heading for California. Mrs. Hoadley once 
                    told her daughter-in-law Beryl Hoadley, the wife of her youngest son, that she walked all of the way to 
                    California, for it was hard riding in a wagon but one day while walking at the head of the train she came 
                    upon a wolf, she stopped and stared, being very afraid, and eventually the wolf went away, and this 
                    experience taught her to never stray that far from the train again. The Hoadleys ended their trek by 
                    taking Noble's Route into Northern California, which had been established a couple of years earlier. 
                    It ended at Fort Reading in Shasta County, where they arrived October the sixth of the same year.</p>       
                    
                    <p>They remained in Shasta City for a short time, before they moved on to Louis's Town (later known as 
                    Lewiston), Trinity County. It was here, on Patented Land, composed of eighty acres, that they raised 
                    their five children; namely: Elias Augustus Hoadley, born 4 November 1854 (the first white child born 
                    in Trinity County); Harriet Mehitable Hoadley, born 2 June 1856; James Francis Hoadley, Jr. born 5 
                    October 1859; Ida Louise Hoadley born 26 September 1868; George Henry Hoadley born 20 March 1872.
