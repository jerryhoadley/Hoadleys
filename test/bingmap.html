						<p><b>PREFACE</b></p>

						<p>Ever since the beginning of the Hoadley Genealogy became a project of mine, and the 
						farther that I delved into it, the more curious I became, as I wondered what route our 
						Great-Grandfather James Francis Hoadley took West, from Hartland, Vermont to Lewiston, 
						California.</p>
						<p> Now, we do know, from all that we have read and heard, that James Francis Hoadley and 
						his bride Harriet Celestial Appleby Hoadley came across the Plains in a wagon by what route, 
						is something that we do not know, but can only conjecture.</p> 
						<p>I have read several books, and most, in the main, furnished in essence the same conclusions. 
						Roads or highways, as we know of them today, were non-existent. There were, of course, roads 
						between towns on the East coast, but for distance travel, rivers were used mostly, and if 
						wagons were the source of travel, they usually traveled alongside the rivers or the ridges 
						above. The crossing of rivers always caused some problems, but they were not insurmountable, 
						it was the numerous creeks encountered along the way that caused much of the distress, because 
						of their narrowness and depth. The wagons were not equipped with any type of braking system, 
						which required wheels to be chained to each other, and/or fallen trees chained to the rear 
						wheels to act as a drag, when the wagons were eased down hills or a mountainside.</p> 
						<p>How James Francis Hoadley traveled from Hartland, Vermont to Springfield, Pennsylvania, 
						where he met and married Harriet Celestial Appleby, and how they traveled from Springfield 
						to the jumping off places. For the West, which in this case is known to be Council Bluffs, 
						Iowa on the Missouri River (as told to the writer by Harriet Louise Hoadley). Harris-who said 
						she was so advised by Harriet Celestial Hoadley. However, if we follow the usual wagon routes 
						which had become pretty well established between 1841 and 1853, the latter being the year that 
						the Hoadleys started West, we can fairly well establish the route they might have taken. I am 
						setting up a route that I think might apply, however each reader may wish to lay out what he or 
						she thinks is the route that applies. In order to do this, it will require some maps from Iowa 
						to the Pacific Coast, and the following are books that I have referred to, and which I found 
						to be most helpful and I heartily recommend;</p>
