                        <p>JAMES FRANCIS HOADLEY, JR. (James Francis #8, Elias #2, Thomas #1), born 5 October, 1859 in Lewiston, Calif.; 
                            died 9 May, 1938 in Eugene, Ore. Married 16 October, 1881 in Cloverdale, Calif. ALTA BELLE NASH, daughter of 
                            Robert and Sarah Nash, born 13 October 1861 in Wisconsin; died 5 December, 1924 in Avon, Calif.</p>

                        <p>James Francis Hoadley, Jr. moved with his parents, brothers and sisters from He attended local schools and 
                            Lewiston, Calif. to Cloverdale, Calif., at age 13 worked in his father's store, until his father sold out in 
                            1875.</p>
                        
                        <p>In 1877, at age 18, Mr. Hoadlay's father purchased The Cloverdale News from W. S. Walker. The following is an 
                            excerpt from the Historical Atlas of Sonoma County, printed in 1877 â€œ------and the paper is now under the 
                            editorial control of J. F. Hoadley, Jr. Mr. Hoadley is young in the business, but makes a readable paper, 
                            etc."</p>
                        
                        <p>In 1884 the City Plot Plan of the City of Cloverdale, Calif., depicted two warehouses owned by the Hoadley family. 
                            The Commission Warehouse operated under the jurisdiction of J. F. Hoadley, Jr. He was thirty-two years of age at 
                            his father's death in 1891. The Republican-Press newspaper of Ukiah, Calif., in its Friday morning October 13, 
                            1893 issue, had the following ad: "Hot Springs Mill Hoadley and Mc Peak, Proprietors. The Hot Springs Mill, 13 
                            miles from Ukiah, is now running. All orders for lumber filled at short notice. Leave orders with either of the 
                            under- signed at their yard offices at the Ukiah Planing Mill. Lumber delivered Free within the Town Limits. 
                            Hoadley and Mc Peak."</p>
                        
                        <p>Shortly thereafter, Mr. Hoadley disposed of his interest in the Planning and Sawmill, and moved with his family 
                            to Keswick, Calif., to work for the Mt. Copper Co., as a building and maintenance foreman. When the Mt. Copper 
                            Co., moved its operations from Keswick to Martinez, Calif., in 1906, he again moved his family, in order to 
                            workat the new site. He continued with the Mt. Copper Co., until his retirement in 1928 at age 69. </p>

                        <p>About this time, Mr. Hoadley's son-in-law Frank Harris bought 160 acres SW of Cloverdale, Mr. Hoadley built a 
                            cabin on the land, and spent his summer months there, into the Deer season, for this is Deer hunting territory. 
                            Peculiar to this area are the California Chamois Deer, which are very small, usually "dressing out" about 
                            seventy-five pounds. This particular type of Deer travels in flocks and browse on grass, not unlike sheep. </p>
                            
                        <p>During the remainder of the year, Mr. Hoadley lived in Martinez. In 1936 he moved to Eugene, Oregon to live with 
                         his son, William Leslie Hoadley, until his death in 1938 at 79 years of age.</p>
