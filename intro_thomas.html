                            <p>The Hoadley family originated in the south of England and is supposed to have derived its
                                name from one of two parishes in Sussex, East and west Hoadly, (now spelled Hoathly),
                                one in the rape of Leues, the other in that of Pevensey.</p>

                            <p>Mention is made in the Sussex Archeological Collections of Margaret; daughter and heir of
                                Solomon de Hothlegh, (about 1280,) of William de Hodlegh, 1296, of Maurice de Hodleye,
                                1318, (11th Edition ii). King Edward II sent Maurice de Hothlegh on an errand from
                                Tunbridge to London.</p>

                            <p>In Queen Elizabethrs time John Hodeley, of Lamberhurst on the borders of Kent and Sussex,
                                had a chancery suit against the vicar.</p>

                            <p>Thomas Hodely, of Sussex, pIeb., of Queens College Oxford, matriculated 7 December 1616,
                                aged 18, B.A. 1629, M.A. 1623.</p>

                            <p>In the 17th century there were a number by the name in various parishes of Sussex and
                                Kent,
                                who were small landholders, and the name is still to be found in those counties. </p>

                            <p>The place of birth neither of John Haadley of Guilford, nor of william of Branford, has
                                as
                                yet been ascertained, though there appears to be reason to suppose that the former came
                                from
                                Kent. That they are related is probable, but the fact rests only at present on family
                                tradition.</p>

                            <h4>Of Hartland, Vermont,and His Descendants</h4>

                            <p>The following are excerpts from the Thomas Hoadley Genealogy, as it relates to his
                                great-great-grandson,
                                James Francis Hoadley III (,fames Francis, Jr. #43 James Francis #8, Elias *2, Thomas
                                #1) and his
                                descendants. The original genealogy was authored by Francis Bacon Trowbridge of New
                                Haven, Conn. in 1894.
                                An extension was added in 1972 by Parker Comstock Hoadley of Sunnyvale, CA.</p>

                            <h6>(1.) THOMAS HOADLEY</h6>
                            <p>Was born in England in 1737. Nothing has been learned of his origin except that there
                                seems to be a pretty general belief among his descendants that he was related to the
                                family to which Bishop
                                Hoadly belonged. He came to America with an only brother JOHN HOADLEY and settled near
                                Boston, Mass. JOHN
                                was unmarried and was drowned about the time of the Revolution. THOMAS married about
                                1760 MARY STONE, whose
                                origin is unknown. Their children were born, it is said “near Boston,” but descendants
                                of their fifth child
                                (Elias) say he was born in Tewkesbury. THOMAS H0ADLEY paid a tax in Brookline in 1771
                                and 1775. He served
                                in the Plassactrueetts Line in the Revolution and drew a pension from April 20, 1818.
                                After the war he
                                moved with his family to Hartland, Vermont, where he bought a farm on which he lived the
                                remainder of his
                                life. His wife MARY died there 13 June 1818, aged 80 years. He died there on 20 June
                                1829. *(*For much of the
